Hi I'm Megan! I make games, robots, robots that play games, and robots that make games :)

I'm interested in creative AI - making systems that can think outside the box and find mutiple creative solutions to a single solution. I also like to make games, pixel art, music, and comics in my spare time when I'm not absorbing new research papers. 

You can check out my [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ywb5hAoAAAAJ&hl=en), [recent games](https://mastermilkx.itch.io), my [programs](https://github.com/MasterMilkX), my [games](https://mastermilkx.github.io/roguecube/) that I made in middle school and high school, and my [twitter](https://twitter.com/MasterMilkX) which is full of memes.
