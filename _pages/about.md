Hi I'm Megan! I make games, robots, robots that play games, and robots that make games :)

I'm interested in creative AI - making systems that can think outside the box and find mutiple creative solutions to a single problem. Some of the areas of research I've explored are in PCG, QD search algorithms, GANs, and transformers. Research I've done in the past includes virtual reality and natural language processing. I also like to make games, pixel art, music, and comics in my spare time when I'm not absorbing new research papers. 

You can check out my [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ywb5hAoAAAAJ&hl=en), [recent games](https://mastermilkx.itch.io), my [programs](https://github.com/MasterMilkX), my [games](https://mastermilkx.github.io/roguecube/) that I made in middle school and high school, and my [twitter](https://twitter.com/MasterMilkX) which is full of memes.
