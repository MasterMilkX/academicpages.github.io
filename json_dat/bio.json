    "bio" : "Hi I’m M Charity (they/them)! I'm currently a visiting assistant professor at the $0.>>My research focuses on creative mixed-initative systems - how AI and humans can work and learn together to create and design better content than they would individually. Some of the areas of research I’ve explored are in PCG, quality diversity and evolutionary search algorithms, GANs, VAEs, and language models. I’ve also previously done research with virtual reality and natural language processing. Here you can read my $5 and watch my $6. You can also check out my $1, my $2, and my $3.>>If you'd like to do research with me, shoot me an email at mcharity6498@gmail.com! Please include a 2 page research proposal in your email with your own idea or check out my $4. I'm always looking for driven students to work with!",
