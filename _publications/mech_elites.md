excerpt: 'This paper introduces a fully automatic method of mechanic illumination for general video game level generation. Using the Constrained MAP-Elites algorithm and the GVG-AI framework, this system generates the simplest tile based levels that contain specific sets of game mechanics and also satisfy playability constraints. We apply this method to illuminate mechanic space for 4 different games in GVG-AI: Zelda, Solarfox, Plants, and RealPortals.'
