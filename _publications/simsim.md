excerpt: 'This paper proposes environment design in the life simulation game The Sims as a novel platform and challenge for testing divergent search algorithms. In this domain, which includes a minimal viability criterion, the goal is to furnish a house with objects that satisfy the physical needs of a simulated agent. Importantly, the large number of objects available to the player (whether human or automated) affords a wide variety of solutions to the underlying design problem. Empirical studies in a novel open source simulator called SimSim investigate the ability of novelty-based evolutionary algorithms to effectively generate viable environment designs.'

This paper proposes environment design in the life simulation game The Sims as a novel platform and challenge for testing divergent search algorithms. In this domain, which includes a minimal viability criterion, the goal is to furnish a house with objects that satisfy the physical needs of a simulated agent. Importantly, the large number of objects available to the player (whether human or automated) affords a wide variety of solutions to the underlying design problem. Empirical studies in a novel open source simulator called SimSim investigate the ability of novelty-based evolutionary algorithms to effectively generate viable environment designs.
